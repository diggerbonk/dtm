After Five Speed Jesus, Andy was living in Virginia. Actually I didn't know where he was and I wasn't really expecting that I'd hear from him again. We weren't that close, had no mutual friends, he'd left a year ago, we were only in a band for a few months, etc. etc.

He wanted me to listen to this new band Uncle Tupelo, but he had lent the cassette to his brother Jeff who lived around the corner. Jeff wasn't home
