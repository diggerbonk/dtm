Marc and I wanted to keep things going after Five Speed split up, so we'd meet at his place on Sundays and write songs, make dinner, then watch 120 minutes. Writing songs was new to me - Marc had written a couple of songs for FSJ, I'd contributed a riff here or there. So after a few months we had some rough songs. I don't remember the particulars but somehow we got connected up with Jeff Brewer (bass) and Jeff Gilman (drums). Did they come as a set?. I don't remember. We were forever looking for a singer and could not find one, so singing fell to me.

Thoughtcrime was a band witout a leader in any sense of the word. All the songs were written more or less collaboratively. No one had veto power. No one could or would make decisions. As you can imagine, there are good and bad parts to this. It was really fun to craft songs as a band. Everyone had a stake in pretty much every song, and anyone could pull a song in any direction they liked within the confines of their instrument. As a result, Thoughtcrime songs were longer and more complete than songs I'd write on my own. When you are a siloed songwriter in a band, especially one with multiple siloed songwriters, you get an allotment of time and attention to teach the band your songs, so the simpler the better.
