The current state of social media sucks, so I'm running an experiment to go back to using RSS like it's 2010 again. Well, not exactly like 2010; in 2013 Google nuked its excellent RSS reader which was my tool of choice back then, this time I'm using an open source tool called <a href="https://miniflux.app">Miniflux</a>. There are other, probably better, readers out there but this one suits my needs.

I know I'm swimming against the tide here, so the point of this post is to explore if using RSS in 2026 is feasible and what kind of content is out there. 
<h2>Finding Feeds to Follow</h2>
The main issue in choosing which feeds to follow, for me anyway, is that the volume of updates is just too high to keep up with. Algorithms solve this problem for you by making decisions on what shows up in your feed. RSS doesn't work that way, when you subscribe to a content source of some sort, you see all the updates from that source. 
<ul>
<li><b>News.</b> Some but not all news outlets publish RSS feeds directly. For ones that don't, they will have some form of social media presence that may or may not be followed with RSS. See the section on news sites below for some examples</li>
<li><b>Fun / Hobbies.</b> Some (most?) online forums allow subscribing to the entire forum or to individual topics. Try typing the topic URL into your RSS reader</li>
<li><b>Members of Congress or other politicians.</b> You will often find an RSS logo on a politicians official website, but these aren't always up to date or frequently updated. It is probably better to find their social media platform of choice, and if that platform supports some form of RSS feed use that - see the section on which platforms support RSS below.
